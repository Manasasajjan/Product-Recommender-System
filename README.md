# ML Recommendation System

Welcome to the **ML Recommendation System** project! This repository demonstrates the implementation of both **content-based** and **collaborative filtering** models, focusing on item recommendations. We explore various collaborative filtering algorithms like **SVD**, **NMF**, and **KNN**, building recommendation systems using Python. Additionally, the project provides a **comparative analysis** of these models on a subset of the **Amazon dataset**.

## Project Overview

Recommendation systems are essential in modern digital platforms, helping users discover items of interest. Whether it's recommending movies, products, music, or articles, an effective recommendation system can significantly boost user engagement. This project showcases the potential of **content-based** and **collaborative filtering** techniques in generating accurate recommendations.

## Key Features

- **Collaborative Filtering**: 
    - Implemented several collaborative filtering models, including memory-based (user-item and item-item) and model-based techniques like **SVD**, **NMF**, and **KNN**.
    - These methods utilize user-item interactions to provide accurate recommendations.

- **Content-Based Filtering**: 
    - Leverages item content attributes, allowing the system to recommend items that align with users' preferences and characteristics.

- **Amazon Dataset**: 
    - Utilized a subset of the [Amazon dataset](https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html) to build and evaluate the recommendation system. This real-world dataset adds practical insights to our analysis.

- **Model Comparison**: 
    - Comprehensive comparison of various collaborative filtering models, examining their performance, strengths, and weaknesses in delivering high-quality recommendations.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to explore the project:

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
https://github.com/Manasasajjan/Product-Recommender-System.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Ensure that all required Python libraries are installed. Use `pip` to install the necessary packages listed in `requirements.txt`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Recommendation System
Explore the provided Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to see the implementation of content-based and collaborative filtering models. You'll find examples of user-item and item-item recommendations, as well as applications of **SVD**, **NMF**, and **KNN**.

### 4. Evaluate Model Performance
